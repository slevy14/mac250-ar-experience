# MAC 250 Augmented Reality Experience
A location-based, augmented reality mobile app developed in Unity. Created as a semester long project in collaboration with a media arts class, the goal was to create an AR application to showcase their final work.

## Features
* 20 AR objects at distinct locations
* Maps for each of the 3 student groups
* Art assets created by the Media Arts class
* Compass and distance tracking to each location
* Video and audio support for AR objects

## Screenshots
GitHub won't led me add screenshots here, but you can find screenshots and gifs of the project [on my website here](https://slevy14.github.io/mac250-screenshots.html).

## Credit / Disclaimer
Version control was done using Unity's now deprecated Unity Collab, hence the lack of commits on GitHub.  
I do not claim ownership to any of the photos or movie snippets in the AR objects, credit belongs to original creators.  
Other UI items created by Philycia Pedrosa and the MAC250 Fall '21 students.
